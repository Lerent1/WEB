        <abbr title=""><i>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for
                her
                autobiographical
                songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular music and
                the
                subject of
                widespread media coverage, with a vast fanbase known as Swifties.</i></abbr><br><br>
        <abbr title=""><i>Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with the
                albums
                Taylor Swift
                (2006)
                and
                Fearless (2008). The singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You Belong with Me" found
                crossover
                success on
                country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012),
                later
                re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014). The ensuing media
                scrutiny
                inspired the
                hip-hop-infused Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "We Are
                Never
                Ever
                Getting Back Together", "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood", and "Look What You Made Me Do".</i>
